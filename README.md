This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `calc()` function: unexpected behavior due to nesting or unit inconsistencies. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a corrected version.  The problem arises from the limitations of older browsers' parsing of `calc()` and how nested calculations can create errors. We present a robust solution that handles unit issues and clarifies the calculations for better cross-browser compatibility.
